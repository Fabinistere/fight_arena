## Assets deported - Ecological Issue

From now on, all my repertory using musics and images changing a lot will have a particular folder in our org's cloud.
To avoid using the git storage for such maters.
Indeed store image in git means if only one pixel changed the git will save the previous and the next image completly.
Which happens to be a pure waste of energy in my case.

SO, to have the assets of the last commit, please download this folder:
